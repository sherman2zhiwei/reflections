What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A metadata file is made of all the commits.
It is necessary to install the .git file that makes a version control git repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows for a 'transition phase' where planning can be done before committing certain files.
This removes the risk of accidentally committing something you did not intend to and
creating an unnecessary one
