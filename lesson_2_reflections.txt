What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A metadata file is made of all the commits.
It is necessary to install the .git file that makes a version control git repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows for a 'transition phase' where planning can be done before committing certain files.
This removes the risk of accidentally committing something you did not intend to and
creating an unnecessary one


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By checking the differences between the staging area and the repo,
you can check that each commit that will be made is 
a logical change.
