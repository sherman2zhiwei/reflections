When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with others or making an open source project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If changes happen in between to your local repo, it might be hard to track whether
they should be kept. Some new features also might not be wanted from the remote
repository


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used only when cloning from github to github
Cloning can be used from local to local or github to local
Branches are only for a logical change big enough to 
warrant it's own 'path'.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work offline without access to an online copy and
discover conflicts and solving them on a local copy first
before pushing them to the public.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or Github, I would probably store a unified server copy
and check with the people I am collaborating with before updating the server
copy. Git requires more steps, but it is much more organized and changes can be 
seen much easier.
